            <h3 class="list-title"><b>A short biography of Kobe Bryant:</b></h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Kobe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 23, 1978. He has two older sisters,
                    Sharia and Shaya. His dad, Jellybean Joe Bryant, was a pro basketball player, too.</li>
                <li>Kobe decided not to attend college and went straight into professional basketball. He said that if he had
                    gone to college, he would have chosen Duke. He was the 13th player taken in the 1996 draft.</li>
                <li>Kobe won 5 NBA championships with the LA Lakers. The first 3 championships were early on in his career (2000-2002).
                    All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal was his teammate at the time.</li>
                <li>After a wildly successful 20 year NBA career, Kobe retired at the end of the 2016 NBA season.
                    He scored 60 points in his final game on April 13, 2016.
                    It was the most points scored by a player in a single game during the 2016 NBA season.</li>
                <li>
                    Sadly, Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others,
                    due to blunt force trauma sustained from a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.

            <h3 class="list-title"><b>What records does Kobe hold?</b></h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Kobe scored 81 points in an NBA game, which is the second most points scored in a single game.</li>
                <li>He holds the record for the most career points scored by a Los Angeles Laker.</li>
                <li>He is the youngest player to score 26,000 career points. He actually held a lot of the "youngest" records
                    in the NBA, but LeBron James is catching him in many categories.</li>
                <li>Kobe was the NBA scoring champion in 2006 and 2007.</li>
                <li>He was selected to the All-NBA Team fifteen times and the All-Defensive Team twelve times.</li>
                <li>At the time of the writing of this article he was third on the all-time NBA scoring list.</li>
